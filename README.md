# Welcome to my JC-Properties-Construction Repo!

# How It Was Made
This client came to me to create their website to futher legitmize their business. Another problem that the client had was that inorder to show potential clients his portflio, he had to go through their personal gallery or instagram. How I decided to solve this was that I would include a gallery tab, formatted in grid, that would highlight his portfolio. In addition I produced a QR code that would help direct clients to his website in a matter of less than 2 clicks! In th website is also his contact information so the potential client doesn't have to worry about writting down his number or losing a business card. The client was super happy with the result! This has helped his online presence but also helped establish credibility with potential clients and has already made him standout! The tech used included: CSS, HTML, and Javascript

# Optimizations
Ways that I would optimize this website in the future would include compressing or shrinking the image file. The images dont load instantaneously and need to be resized. This could potentially be a problem in the future if more pictures get added to the gallery.

# Lessons Learned
I sharpened a lot of my skill on this project. I learned how to work with text shadows, picture gradients and most importantly how to play with my grid layout so that the pictures look great as a layout on desktop but can be fully sized on mobile. I learned to triple check your work! Even if you've committed 10x, check it once more! 
This website felt like a home run for me. I used all my skills that Ive accumulated up until this point in life. I used my communication skills, management, technical skills to create a product that my client loved and is happy to show everyone to crosses their path!

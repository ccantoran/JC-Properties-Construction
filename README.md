# Welcome to my JC-Properties-Construction Repo!
This repo is for my client. I made their website to show case their work and be more professional. 


# How It Was Made
tech used included: CSS, HTML, and Javascript

# Optimizations
What I would do in the future would include having an option to contact the business owner through email. At this time, business owner did not want to used email but
would be potentially open to that idea in the future. 

# Lessons Learned
One of my biggest lessons was my battle with media queries and my picture grid outline. The images did shrink as a grid outline should but it did not reflect 
the parts that my client wanted to highlight.

# Welcome to my JC-Properties-Construction Repo!
This repo is for my client. This client wanted me to make them a website that highlighted their work portfolio. 

Check out the live site!

# How It Was Made
tech used included: CSS, HTML, and Javascript
This cliented needed a better way to show their clients their work on the spot without having to go through their personal gallery or instagram. I figured out that they best way to show them the gallery would be to have a tab on the website that would show all the projects in one spot. The client chose to not have business cards so we settled on a QR code. This QR code was made into a sticker so that client could show and direct clients to the website that would have his contact information as well, in less than 2 clicks! This helped his online presence but also helped establish credibility with potential clients which makes him standout! 

# Optimizations
What I would do in the future would include having an option to contact the business owner through email. At this time, business owner did not want to used email but
would be potentially open to that idea in the future. I would compress my images. The images dont load immediately and they need to be resized. This could potentially be a problem in the future if more pictures get added to the gallery. 

# Lessons Learned
I learned small details that I know will help me on my path. I learned how to work with text shadows, picture gradients and most importantly how to play with my grid layout so that the pictures look great as a layout on desktop but can be fully sized on mobile. 
I learned to triple check your work! Even if you committed 10x, check it once more! 
This website felt like a home run for me. I used all my skills that Ive accumulated up until this point in life in all ways. I used my communication skills, management, to technical skills which included web development to create a product that my client loved and is happy to show everyone to crosses their path!
